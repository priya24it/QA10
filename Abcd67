Thanks for the kind words! I appreciate the perspective, and I’m glad to bring a bit of an “eclectic” angle to the work we do. I’m definitely looking forward to exchanging ideas and learning from your experience as well—especially around structured testing practices.

Happy to share how I approach ambiguous or less-defined areas, and I’d love to collaborate on streamlining how we tackle those together.
