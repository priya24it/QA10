Hereâ€™s a clearer and more polished version of your questions:
	1.	Every file ends with the last 4 digits following the date. Is this expected behavior?
	2.	In the file DOG_EQIR_CLIENT_EXTRACT_20250414, the entry ending in 2010 is missing. Is this expected?
	3.	There are two fields related to the organization. Currently, I am using ORG_Name. Should I also be using ORG-NAME and ORG-ADDL-NAME? Is this expected?
