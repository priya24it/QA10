User Story: QA Validation of Trips Data Pipeline (SQL Server to BigQuery)

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate the ingestion, transformation, and deployment of trips data from SQL Server to BigQuery,
So that I can ensure data integrity, correct UTC date conversion, PCI compliance, and adherence to functional business requirements.

⸻

Test Scenarios & Expected Outcomes:

⸻

TS001: Validate total trips record count between SQL Server and BigQuery
Expected Outcome: Record count in BigQuery matches SQL Server after considering filters, deletions, or transformation logic.

⸻

TS002: Validate datetime fields (e.g., trip_start_time, trip_end_time) are converted to UTC
Expected Outcome: All datetime values in BigQuery are accurately converted to UTC based on original time zone logic.

⸻

TS003: Compare a sample set of trip records between SQL Server and BigQuery
Expected Outcome: Fields like trip_id, vehicle_id, status, and location details match exactly or as per transformation rules.

⸻

TS004: Verify field-level data integrity for critical columns in trips (e.g., fare, distance, duration)
Expected Outcome: All critical numeric and categorical fields match or reflect correct calculated values based on business logic.

⸻

TS005: Validate PCI-sensitive parameters (e.g., payment info, card data, PII) are masked or removed
Expected Outcome: No raw PCI or PII data exists in BigQuery; fields are encrypted, redacted, or excluded per compliance policies.

⸻

TS006: Test action parameter mapping (create, update, delete) from SQL Server to BigQuery
Expected Outcome: Action parameters in BigQuery correctly reflect the operation type based on source data logic.

⸻

TS007: Validate deployment of pipeline jobs from SQL Server to BigQuery
Expected Outcome: All ETL/ELT jobs complete successfully with proper logging and without data corruption or schema failures.

⸻

TS008: Run smoke tests after deployment to ensure data availability and transformation success
Expected Outcome: BigQuery reflects fresh, consistent data with up-to-date snapshots after deployment.

⸻

TS009: Validate schema mapping between SQL Server and BigQuery
Expected Outcome: All fields are mapped correctly (e.g., data types, names, nullable vs. non-nullable), and schema changes are versioned or documented.

⸻

TS010: Document mismatches, errors, or exceptions during QA and raise issues with reproduction steps
Expected Outcome: All discrepancies are logged in QA tools (e.g., JIRA, Confluence, TestRail) and tracked to resolution.
